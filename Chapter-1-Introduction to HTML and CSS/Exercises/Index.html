  <p> Excellent recipe for fast chicken breasts
    I find myself adding chicken breast to my shopping cart week after week, even though I personally prefer chicken thighs than chicken breast (better flavor, juicier!).
    
    As a result, I have developed a large repertoire of quick and simple chicken breast dishes over the years, and this Honey Garlic Chicken is one of my favorite quick dinners that I frequently make.
    </p>

    <p>It’s a quick and easy recipe that takes only 12 minutes to prepare, and it’s made with a simple 5-ingredient sauce that is so delicious that you’ll want to make it again and again.</p>

        <li>Add butter, garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and seared chicken.</li>
